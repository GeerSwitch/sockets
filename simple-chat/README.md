# Basic socket implementation

Proof of concept of a simple chat application.  Users are notified of when other
connected parties are typing (and stop), as well as differently colored
bubbles.

## Up and running

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- `npm run server`

Open two browsers/tabs and navigate to `http://localhost:8888/client`.

Talk to yourself.
