# Basic socket implementation

Bare minimum example of connecting to a local websocket server.  One connected,
the server will emit some `lorem ipsum` messages and disconnect once there are no
more messages.

## Up and running

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- `npm run server`

Open a browser to `http://localhost:8888/client`.
