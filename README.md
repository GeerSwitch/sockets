# Socket.IO examples

A few small examples illustrating the use of Socket.IO.  Sometimes the 
documentation can be sparse and have a lot of omissions for the sake of
brevity, so I'm attempting to create some more complete examples.

## Structure

Each directory has its own package and functionality. `cd` into each and follow the readme.

### Table of Contents

- `basic`
  - Minimalist example of `on` and `emit`.
- `namespace`
  - Showing how namespaces can work.
- `simple-chat`
  - iOS themed chat, utilizing `socket.broadcast.emit`.

### Coming up

- JWT Authentication
- Integrating Redis
- More complex room/namespace examples
